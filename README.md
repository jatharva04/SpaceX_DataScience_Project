# üöÄ SpaceX_DataScience_Project

Applied Data Science Capstone Project - Coursera

## üìñ Overview

This project is part of the Applied Data Science Capstone provided by IBM on Coursera. The goal of this project is to apply all the skills learned during the specialization to solve a real-world data science problem.

In this project, we work with **SpaceX** data to **predict the landing success of Falcon 9 first stage**. The success of landing has a direct influence on the cost of launches, as reusability significantly reduces operational costs for SpaceX.

If we can accurately predict whether the Falcon 9 will land successfully, this can provide competitive insight for other companies aiming to bid against SpaceX for satellite launches.
